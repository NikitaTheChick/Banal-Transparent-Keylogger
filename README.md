# Banal-Transparent-Keylogger
A non-malicious, trivially detectable keylogger that patently tells you it's logging your keyboard events before also telling you it's sending your keyboard events to a party of your choice. Both API and SMTP functionality. Mailgun API, but should work with most if you tweak the code.
